    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>We use PostHog, an analytics service, to track user interactions and improve the app experience. The data collected by PostHog is stored on EU servers and is used solely for app analytics purposes. No third parties, except PostHog, have access to your data.</p>

        <li>Request the deletion of your data. However, you cannot delete specific analytics data, as it is stored on your device and handled by PostHog.</li>
        <li>Object to the processing of your data, though you may experience reduced functionality of the app if you do so.</li>
    </ul>
